# In-Class Programming Activity, Day 17

Delia Walker-Jones

```{r}
library(tree)
Cartoon_data <- data.frame(
x = 1:8,
y = c(2,5,1,3,8,5,4,6),
class = c("A", "B", "A", "A", "B", "B", "A", "B")
)

pure <- tree.control(8, mincut = 0, minsize = 1, mindev = 0)

# Regression problem
rtree_pure <- tree(y ~ x, data=Cartoon_data, control = pure)
plot(rtree_pure)
text(rtree_pure)
```
For x = 3, we predict y to be between 1 or 3.

```{r}
# Classification problem
ctree_pure <- tree(class ~ x, data=Cartoon_data, control = pure)
plot(ctree_pure)
text(ctree_pure)

```
We predict x=7 to be B.
