The curve is linear between -2 and 1 and quadratic after 1.

## 7.9.4

It's constant between -2 and -1, and 0 and 1, but linear elsewhere.

## 7.9.5
### A. 
As lambda approaches infinity, the smoother spline g2 will have smaller training RSS because it's more flexible and is a higher-degree polynomial.

### B. 
As lambda approaches infinity, the smoother spline g1 will have smaller test RSS because g2 will be too flexible and overfit.

### C.
If lambda is 0, g1 and g2 will cancel out and have the same RSS for training and testing; the functions will be the same thing because there's no smoothing.

## 7.9.11
